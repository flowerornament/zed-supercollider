Add Zed task `SuperCollider: Help` that takes selection\n2. Construct URL: `https://docs.supercollider.online/Classes/${SYMBOL}`\n3. Run `open \"$URL\"` to launch in default browser\n\n## Pros\n- Very simple, no server changes needed\n- Docs are always up-to-date\n- Full search, navigation, cross-references work\n\n## Cons\n- Leaves Zed (context switch)\n- Requires internet\n- Need to handle non-class docs (Guides, Reference, etc.)\n\n## URL patterns\n- Classes: `/Classes/SinOsc`\n- Guides: `/Guides/Introduction`  \n- Reference: `/Reference/Literals`\n- Search: `/Search.html?query=...`\n\n## Research findings\n\n### Online docs\n- Hosted at https://docs.supercollider.online\n- Built from schelp via Docker/sclang → HTML (supercollider/sc-docs repo)\n- Updated weekly from latest SC release\n- Has search functionality at `/Search.html`\n\n### Zed task integration\n- Can use `ZED_SELECTED_TEXT` or `ZED_CUSTOM_*` env vars\n- Existing tasks in `.zed/tasks.json` show the pattern\n- `open` command on macOS opens URLs in default browser\n\n### Why not LSP-based?\n- `window/showDocument` not implemented in Zed (Discussion #24852)\n- When LSP servers try to use it, Zed just shows text notification\n- Users must manually copy URL - bad UX\n\n### Fallback behavior\n- If symbol not found as class, could fall back to search URL\n- `/Search.html?query=SinOsc` shows search results\n\n## Implementation sketch\n```json\n{\n  \"label\": \"SuperCollider: Help\",\n  \"command\": \"bash\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"-lc\",\n    \"SYMBOL=\\\"${ZED_SELECTED_TEXT:-}\\\"; [ -z \\\"$SYMBOL\\\" ] \u0026\u0026 exit 0; open \\\"https://docs.supercollider.online/Classes/$SYMBOL\\\"\"\n  ],\n  \"reveal\": \"never\",\n  \"hide\": \"on_success\"\n}\n```\n\n## Open questions\n- How to determine if selection is a class vs method vs guide?\n- Fallback to search if exact match not found?\n- Should we validate the symbol exists first (via quark) before opening?","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-09T14:28:23.985027-08:00","created_by":"morgan","updated_at":"2026-01-10T18:47:37.818621-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-10T18:47:37.818621-08:00","close_reason":"Prototype complete.

{"id":"zed-supercollider-j42","title":"Distribution strategy: research and decision","description":"Comprehensive research on distribution strategy for zed-supercollider. Goal: make the extension installable for non-professional programmers (students, artists) with minimal friction, as close to the default SuperCollider IDE experience as possible.\n\n## Target Audience\n- Students learning SuperCollider\n- Artists/musicians who aren't professional programmers\n- Users who expect \"download and it works\" experience\n- Users who may not have Rust toolchain, Homebrew, or terminal comfort\n\n## Research Findings\n\n### Zed Extension Capabilities\n\n**What extensions CAN do:**\n- Auto-download binaries at runtime via GitHub releases (how rust-analyzer, pyright work)\n- Use `download_file()`, `get_github_release()`, `make_file_executable()` APIs\n- Write to workspace directories (project-local .zed/)\n- Define slash commands\n- Define runnables via runnables.scm\n\n**What extensions CANNOT do:**\n- Bundle native binaries in the extension itself (WASM sandbox)\n- Write to user config (~/.config/zed/tasks.json, settings.json)\n- Run post-install scripts\n- Automatically install SuperCollider Quarks\n\n**Discovery order for language servers:**\n1. User-configured path (lsp.{server}.binary.path in settings)\n2. System PATH search\n3. Automatic download from GitHub releases\n\n### SuperCollider Ecosystem Patterns\n\n**Official SC IDE:**\n- Batteries-included: download one installer, everything works\n- Bundles scsynth, sclang, scide, docs, Quarks manager\n- Students expect this level of polish\n\n**VS Code SC Extension:**\n- Requires separate SC app install\n- Requires manual sclang path configuration in settings\n- Some extensions require manual Quarks.install(\"LanguageServer\")\n- Not a great UX benchmark\n\n**Quarks for end users:**\n- GUI available via Quarks.gui (user-friendly)\n- Must recompile class library after install\n- Our fork conflicts with upstream LanguageServer name\n\n### Current Component State\n\n**Launcher (sc_launcher):**\n- Rust binary, ~1.8 MB release build\n- Bridges LSP stdio↔UDP between Zed and LanguageServer.quark\n- HTTP server for code eval (port 57130)\n- Already has vendored quark discovery logic\n\n**LanguageServer.quark:**\n- ~288 KB (50 files)\n- Forked from upstream with critical fixes\n- Vendored as submodule at server/quark/LanguageServer.quark/\n- Cannot use upstream—our fork has fixes for crashes, timing, logging\n\n**Extension:**\n- Grammar WASM, queries, snippets, runnables\n- ~24 KB language assets\n- Currently requires manual launcher path config\n\n---\n\n## Distribution Approaches\n\n### Approach A: Auto-Download Bundle (RECOMMENDED)\n\n**User experience:**\n1. User installs extension from Zed marketplace (one click)\n2. User opens a .sc file\n3. Extension auto-downloads from GitHub releases:\n   - Platform-specific tarball (darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, linux-x64, windows-x64)\n   - Contains: sc_launcher binary + LanguageServer.quark folder\n4. Extracts to ~/.local/share/zed/languages/supercollider/\n5. LSP starts working immediately\n\n**What we'd build:**\n- GitHub Actions workflow for multi-platform release builds\n- Tarball packaging with launcher + quark bundled\n- Extension code: platform detection, download, extract, set executable\n- Version checking for auto-updates\n\n**Tradeoffs:**\n- (+) No toolchain required (no cargo, no brew)\n- (+) Cross-platform with single approach\n- (+) Closest to \"just works\"\n- (-) Windows code signing ($300+/year) or \"untrusted publisher\" warning\n- (-) macOS may need notarization ($99/year) or users right-click → Open\n- (-) Quark updates require new launcher release\n\n**Uninstall:** Delete extension. Downloaded files stay in ~/.local/share/zed/languages/\n\n### Approach B: Installer Script\n\n**User experience:**\n```bash\n# macOS/Linux\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../install.sh | bash\n\n# Windows PowerShell\nirm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../install.ps1 | iex\n```\n\n**Script actions:**\n1. Detect OS and architecture\n2. Download latest release tarball\n3. Extract to ~/.local/bin/sc_launcher\n4. Copy quark to ~/.local/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/\n5. Optionally write tasks to ~/.config/zed/tasks.json\n6. Print completion message\n\n**What we'd build:**\n- install.sh with platform detection\n- install.ps1 for Windows\n- uninstall.sh / uninstall.ps1\n- Same GitHub Actions releases as Approach A\n\n**Tradeoffs:**\n- (+) Can automate tasks.json setup\n- (+) Familiar pattern for developers\n- (+) Explicit user control\n- (-) Requires terminal comfort\n- (-) curl|bash controversial (security concerns)\n- (-) Students may not know how to open Terminal\n\n### Approach C: Native Platform Installers\n\n**macOS (.pkg):**\n- Standard installer wizard\n- Installs to /usr/local/bin/ and /Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/\n- Post-install script could write tasks.json\n\n**Windows (.msi):**\n- Standard installer wizard\n- Installs to C:\\Program Files\\SuperCollider-Zed\\\n- Adds to PATH automatically\n\n**Linux (.deb/.rpm/AppImage):**\n- Package manager or standalone AppImage\n\n**What we'd build:**\n- macOS: pkgbuild/productbuild scripts\n- Windows: WiX or Inno Setup\n- Linux: debian packaging, RPM spec, AppImage recipe\n- Code signing certificates\n\n**Tradeoffs:**\n- (+) Best native UX per platform\n- (+) Standard uninstall mechanisms\n- (-) Significant packaging work per platform\n- (-) Code signing costs ($99-$300+/year)\n- (-) Maintenance burden for updates\n\n---\n\n## Tasks.json Solutions\n\nCore problem: Zed extensions cannot write to user config (~/.config/zed/tasks.json). But we need tasks for Eval/Boot/Stop/Post Window.\n\n### Idea 1: Auto-Generate Per-Project .zed/tasks.json (RECOMMENDED)\n\n**How it works:**\n- Extension detects folder with .sc files\n- If no .zed/tasks.json exists, extension creates it automatically\n- Treats .zed/ like .vscode/ - editor config in project\n\n**Feasibility:** Extensions CAN write to workspace directory. This should work.\n\n**Tradeoffs:**\n- (+) Zero config, invisible to user\n- (+) Every SC project gets tasks automatically\n- (-) Creates files in user's project\n- (-) Some users dislike auto-generated files\n- Mitigation: Add .zed/ to common .gitignore patterns\n\n### Idea 2: Runnables as Primary Interface\n\n**How it works:**\n- Runnables already detect (...) blocks via runnables.scm\n- User clicks ▶ button next to code blocks\n- Could offer Eval/Boot/Stop options\n\n**Tradeoffs:**\n- (+) Very discoverable (buttons in editor)\n- (+) No config needed\n- (-) Need to verify runnables can replace tasks fully\n- (-) May still need tasks for Boot/Stop server\n\n### Idea 3: Slash Commands for Everything\n\n**How it works:**\n- /sc-eval, /sc-boot, /sc-stop, /sc-post commands\n- Hit HTTP API directly from extension\n\n**Tradeoffs:**\n- (+) Works everywhere, no tasks.json needed\n- (+) User learns once\n- (-) Less discoverable than task runner\n- (-) No keyboard shortcuts by default\n\n### Idea 4: First-Run Setup Wizard\n\n**How it works:**\n- /sc-setup slash command\n- Checks prerequisites, prints status\n- Offers to create .zed/tasks.json in current project\n- Copies config to clipboard for global tasks.json\n\n**Tradeoffs:**\n- (+) Guided setup, user feels in control\n- (+) Teaches user about the system\n- (-) Extra step after install\n\n### Idea 5: Opinionated Default (variant of Idea 1)\n\n**How it works:**\n- Extension ALWAYS creates .zed/tasks.json when opening SC files\n- Document clearly: \"Extension manages .zed/tasks.json\"\n- If user deletes it, recreate on next open\n\n**Tradeoffs:**\n- (+) Zero config\n- (-) Some users will complain\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations\n\n**Distribution:** Approach A (auto-download bundle) as primary, with Approach B (installer script) documented for power users who prefer explicit control.\n\n**Tasks:** Idea 1 (auto-generate .zed/tasks.json per project) combined with Idea 4 (setup wizard /sc-setup) for discoverability and troubleshooting.\n\n**Quark:** Bundle with launcher in release tarball. Launcher already has vendored quark discovery logic.\n\n---\n\n## Comparison to VS Code SC Extension\n\n| Step | VS Code | Zed (proposed) |\n|------|---------|----------------|\n| Install SC app | Manual | Manual |\n| Install extension | Marketplace | Marketplace |\n| Configure sclang path | Manual settings | Auto-detected |\n| Install quark | Manual Quarks.install | Bundled (auto) |\n| Configure tasks | N/A | Auto-generated |\n\nWe would be BETTER than VS Code on quark handling and tasks if we implement this.\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Code signing: Is $99-$300/year acceptable for notarization/signing?\n2. Auto-update: How aggressive should version checking be?\n3. .zed/ gitignore: Should we advocate adding .zed/ to .gitignore templates?\n4.
