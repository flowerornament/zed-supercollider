# scnvim Reference Snapshot

This directory vendors selected scnvim documentation as immutable reference material to guide feature parity and tests. These files are for contributors only; end‑user docs live elsewhere under `docs/`.

Principles
- Snapshot, don’t mirror: copy only what supports parity and acceptance tests.
- Pin and attribute: record source URLs, commit SHA, and license in `SOURCES.md` and `NOTICE`.
- No edits: keep raw copies; add short notes in `NOTES.md` if needed.

See `SOURCES.md` for what’s included and the pinned commit.
